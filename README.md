Smart Bookmark App

A real-time bookmark manager built with modern web technologies — Next.js (App Router), Supabase (Auth, Database, Realtime), and Tailwind CSS.
Users can sign in with Google, add and delete bookmarks, and see updates instantly across multiple browser tabs.

This project was developed as a fullstack micro-challenge submission and demonstrates core skills in authentication, data modeling, real-time sync, and cloud deployment.
